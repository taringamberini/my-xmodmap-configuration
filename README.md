# my-xmodmap-configuration
My current [xmodmap](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xmodmap) configuration file.

## Requirement
Git MUST be installed.

## Installation
The laptops keyboard is different from the desktops one, therefore I have configured them differently.

### Laptop
To install on laptop run at command line:

```bash
$ wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taringamberini/my-xmodmap-configuration/master/install-laptop-keyboard.sh
$ sh install-laptop-keyboard.sh
```

You can see the configuration in the file [xmodmaprc-laptop-keyboard](xmodmaprc-laptop-keyboard).

### Desktop
To install on desktop run at command line:

```bash
$ wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taringamberini/my-xmodmap-configuration/master/install-desktop-keyboard.sh
$ sh install-desktop-keyboard.sh
```

You can see the configuration in the file [xmodmaprc-desktop-keyboard](xmodmaprc-desktop-keyboard).
