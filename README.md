# my-xmodmap-configuration
My current Xmodmap configuration file

## Installation

The laptops keyboard is different from the desktops one, therefore I configure them differently.

### Laptop Installation

```bash
$ wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taringamberini/my-xmodmap-configuration/master/install-laptop-keyboard.sh
$ sh install-laptop-keyboard.sh
```
### Desktop Installation

```bash
$ wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taringamberini/my-xmodmap-configuration/master/install-desktop-keyboard.sh
$ sh install-desktop-keyboard.sh
```
